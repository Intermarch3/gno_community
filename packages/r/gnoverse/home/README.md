# Gnoverse home


Welcome! 

As you can see, the path to this from root is community/packages/r/gnoverse/home. This follows
the standard [Gno package path structure](https://docs.gno.land/resources/gno-packages#package-path-structure).

Soon, after issue #4 is completed, everything under packages/ will be deployed to
the Staging network periodically, if not conflicting with monorepo pkgpaths).

Please, follow my lead and create your Gno packages like I did in my own namespace.

Let's build this community together!
