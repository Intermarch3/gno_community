# Community

Welcome to the Community repo. This repo is community-maintained.

Build Gno in [packages/](./packages).

Repo steps/improvements (please, work on some!):
- [ ] Connect the contracts/ folder to the `gnoverse` namespace on Staging
  - [ ] Figure out how to manage deployer address (maybe via `gnomod.toml`?)
- [ ] Setup basic CI to test p/ & r/ in packages/
- [ ] Migrate some/most of the personal packages from [examples/](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/examples) here.
Start migrating the process of new exmaples/ from the monorepo to here.
